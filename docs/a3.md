### Diagnosis

The definition of `CERT_DestroyCrl` in `/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c` and `/security/nss/lib/certdb/cert.h` is redundant since it is simplying passing the input to the function into `SEC_DestroyCrl`.

### Solution

The first iteration of the attempted fix was to simply commenting the definitions in both files out, and observing the effectes (Firefox built and ran with no errors). However, upon closer inspection and searching, it was found that `CERT_DestroyCrl` was being called in `/security/nss/lib/libpkix/pkix_pl_nss/pki/pkix_pl_crl.c`, therefore all references were changed to `SEC_DestroyCrl`.
