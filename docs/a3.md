### Diagnosis

The definition of `CERT_DestroyCrl` in `/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c` and `/security/nss/lib/certdb/cert.h` is redundant since it is simplying passing the input to the function into `SEC_DestroyCrl`.

### Solution

The first iteration of the attempted fix was to simply commenting the definitions in both files out, and observing the effectes (Firefox built and ran with no errors). However, upon closer inspection and searching, it was found that `CERT_DestroyCrl` was being called in `/security/nss/lib/libpkix/pkix_pl_nss/pki/pkix_pl_crl.c`, therefore all references were changed to `SEC_DestroyCrl`.

Here is a screenshot of the fix (can also be seen in the patch):

### Testing

The same testing procedure was conducted twice, which is updating the codebase and rebuild Firefox (`mach build && mach run`). For the first test, it was to observe the effects of simply removing the definitions of `CERT_DestroyCrl`, to which no side effects were observed, Firefox built and ran with no errors. The second test was to see if changing the references of `CERT_DestroyCrl` to `SEC_DestroyCrl` has any side effects, and no errors were found when building and running Firefox.

### Collaboration
